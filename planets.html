        Far smaller and closer to the Sun than it should be, Mercury has long
        baffled astronomers because it defies much of what we know about planet
        formation. A new space mission arriving in 2026 might solve the mystery.

      At a cursory glance, Mercury might well be the Solar System's dullest
      planet. Its barren surface has few notable features, there is no evidence
      of water in its past and the planet's wispy atmosphere is tenuous at best.
      The likelihood of life being found amidst its scotched craters is
      non-existent. Yet, look closer and Mercury is a fascinating, improbable
      world that is shrouded in mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Planetary scientists remain flummoxed by the very existence of the closest
      planet to our Sun. This peculiar planet is tiny, 20 times less massive
      than Earth and barely wider than Australia. Yet Mercury is the second
      densest planet in our Solar System after Earth due to a large, metallic
      core that accounts for the majority of its mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mercury's orbit – hugging close to our Sun – is also in a weird location
      that astronomers can't quite explain. All this ties together into one
      crucial point – we have no idea how Mercury formed. As far as we can tell,
      the planet simply shouldn't exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's kind of embarrassing," says Sean Raymond, an expert in planetary
      formation and dynamics at the University of Bordeaux in France. "There's
      some key subtlety that we're missing."
    </p>
    <p>
      The mystery of where Mercury came from, how it formed and why it looks
      like it does today is one of the grandest mysteries in the Solar System.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some answers, however, might be on the horizon. A joint European and
      Japanese mission called BepiColombo launched in 2018 and is currently on
      its way to Mercury. The probe will be our first visitor to the planet in
      more than a decade. When it enters orbit in November 2026, after a
      thruster problem delayed its journey, one of its key goals is to try and
      work exactly where Mercury came from.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working out how Mercury formed is not just important for understanding
      more about the origins of our own Solar System, but also for studying
      planets around other stars – exoplanets – too.
