    <h1>MERCURY</h1>
    <img src="images/mercury1.jpg" alt="Mercury Image Planet" />
    <p>
      <strong>
        Far smaller and closer to the Sun than it should be, Mercury has long
        baffled astronomers because it defies much of what we know about planet
        formation. A new space mission arriving in 2026 might solve the mystery.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      At a cursory glance, Mercury might well be the Solar System's dullest
      planet. Its barren surface has few notable features, there is no evidence
      of water in its past and the planet's wispy atmosphere is tenuous at best.
      The likelihood of life being found amidst its scotched craters is
      non-existent. Yet, look closer and Mercury is a fascinating, improbable
      world that is shrouded in mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Planetary scientists remain flummoxed by the very existence of the closest
      planet to our Sun. This peculiar planet is tiny, 20 times less massive
      than Earth and barely wider than Australia. Yet Mercury is the second
      densest planet in our Solar System after Earth due to a large, metallic
      core that accounts for the majority of its mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mercury's orbit – hugging close to our Sun – is also in a weird location
      that astronomers can't quite explain. All this ties together into one
      crucial point – we have no idea how Mercury formed. As far as we can tell,
      the planet simply shouldn't exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's kind of embarrassing," says Sean Raymond, an expert in planetary
      formation and dynamics at the University of Bordeaux in France. "There's
      some key subtlety that we're missing."
    </p>
    <p>
      The mystery of where Mercury came from, how it formed and why it looks
      like it does today is one of the grandest mysteries in the Solar System.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some answers, however, might be on the horizon. A joint European and
      Japanese mission called BepiColombo launched in 2018 and is currently on
      its way to Mercury. The probe will be our first visitor to the planet in
      more than a decade. When it enters orbit in November 2026, after a
      thruster problem delayed its journey, one of its key goals is to try and
      work exactly where Mercury came from.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working out how Mercury formed is not just important for understanding
      more about the origins of our own Solar System, but also for studying
      planets around other stars – exoplanets – too.

    <h1>VENUS</h1>
    <img src="images/venus1.jpg" alt="Venus Image Planet" />
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and Earth's closest planetary
      neighbor. Venus is the third brightest object in the sky after the Sun and
      Moon. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Venus is similar in structure and size to Earth, and is sometimes called
      Earth's evil twin. Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse
      effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system with surface
      temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Below the dense, persistent clouds,
      the surface has volcanoes and deformed mountains.
    </p>
    <h3>Potential for Life</h3>
    <p>
      Thirty miles up (about 50 kilometers) from the surface of Venus
      temperatures range from 86 to 158 Fahrenheit (30 to 70 Celsius). This
      temperature range could accommodate Earthly life, such as “extremophile”
      microbes. And atmospheric pressure at that height is similar to what we
      find on Earth’s surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the tops of Venus’ clouds, whipped around the planet by winds measured
      as high as 224 mph (360 kph), we find another transformation. Persistent,
      dark streaks appear. Scientists are so far unable to explain why these
      streaks remain stubbornly intact, even amid hurricane-force winds. They
      also have the odd habit of absorbing ultraviolet radiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most likely explanations focus on fine particles, ice crystals, or
      even a chemical compound called iron chloride. Although it's much less
      likely, another possibility considered by scientists who study
      astrobiology is that these streaks could be made up of microbial life,
      Venus-style. Astrobiologists note that ring-shaped linkages of sulfur
      atoms, known to exist in Venus’ atmosphere, could provide microbes with a
      kind of coating that would protect them from sulfuric acid. These handy
      chemical cloaks would also absorb potentially damaging ultraviolet light
      and re-radiate it as visible light.
    </p>
    <h3>Size and Distance</h3>
    <p>
      Venus orbits the Sun from an average distance of 67 million miles (108
      million kilometers), or 0.72 astronomical units. One astronomical unit
      (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this
      distance, it takes sunlight about six minutes to travel from the Sun to
      Venus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Earth's nearness to Venus is a matter of perspective. The planet is nearly
      as big around as Earth. Its diameter at its equator is about 7,521 miles
      (12,104 kilometers), versus 7,926 miles (12,756 kilometers) for Earth.
      From Earth, Venus is the brightest object in the night sky after our own
      Moon. The ancients, therefore, gave it great importance in their cultures,
      even thinking it was two objects: a morning star and an evening star.
      That’s where the trick of perspective comes in.

    <h1>EARTH</h1>
    <img src="images/earth1.jpg" alt="Earth Image Planet" />
    <p>
      While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is
      the only planet in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just
      slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four
      planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Earth is the only planet in the solar system whose English name does not
      come from Greek or Roman mythology. The name was taken from Old English
      and Germanic. It simply means "the ground." There are, of course, many
      names for our planet in the thousands of languages spoken by the people of
      the third planet from the Sun.
    </p>
    <h3>Potential for Life</h3>
    <p>
      Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have
      made life abundant here. Most notably, Earth is unique in that most of our
      planet is covered in liquid water, since the temperature allows liquid
      water to exist for extended periods of time. Earth's vast oceans provided
      a convenient place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago.
    </p>
    <h3>Size and Distance</h3>
    <p>
      With an equatorial diameter of 7,926 miles (12,756 kilometers), Earth is
      the biggest of the terrestrial planets and the fifth largest planet in our
      solar system.
    </p>
    <p>
      From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers),
      Earth is exactly one astronomical unit away from the Sun because one
      astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to
      Earth. This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare planets'
      distances from the Sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.

    <h1>MARS</h1>
    <img src="images/mars1.jpg" alt="Mars Image Planet" />
    <p>
      Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the
      only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape. NASA
      missions have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer,
      with a thicker atmosphere, billions of years ago.
    </p>
    <h3>Namesake</h3>
    <p>
      Mars was named by the ancient Romans for their god of war because its
      reddish color was reminiscent of blood. Other civilizations also named the
      planet for this attribute – for example, the Egyptians called it "Her
      Desher," meaning "the red one." Even today, it is frequently called the
      "Red Planet" because iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust,
      causing the surface to look red.
    </p>
    <h3>Potantial For Life</h3>
    <p>
      Scientists don't expect to find living things currently thriving on Mars.
      Instead, they're looking for signs of life that existed long ago, when
      Mars was warmer and covered with water
    </p>
    <h3>Size and Distance</h3>
    <p>
      With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the
      size of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mars would be about as
      big as a raspberry.
    </p>
    <p>
      From an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers),
      Mars is 1.5 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit
      (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this
      distance, it takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mars.
    </p>
    <h3>Orbit and Rotation</h3>
    <p>
      As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours, which
      is very similar to one day on Earth (23.9 hours). Martian days are called
      sols – short for "solar day." A year on Mars lasts 669.6 sols, which is
      the same as 687 Earth days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mars' axis of rotation is tilted 25 degrees with respect to the plane of
      its orbit around the Sun. This is another similarity with Earth, which has
      an axial tilt of 23.4 degrees. Like Earth, Mars has distinct seasons, but
      they last longer than seasons here on Earth since Mars takes longer to
      orbit the Sun (because it's farther away). And while here on Earth the
      seasons are evenly spread over the year, lasting 3 months (or one quarter
      of a year), on Mars the seasons vary in length because of Mars'
      elliptical, egg-shaped orbit around the Sun.
