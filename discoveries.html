    <h2>NEO Surveyor</h2>
    <img src="images/NEOsurveyor.jpg" alt="Neo Surveyor Image" />
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Building on the success of NASA's NEOWISE space telescope, the agency's
      NEO Surveyor will be the first spacecraft built specifically to find large
      numbers of asteroids and comets that are potentially hazardous to Earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it scans the solar system, NEO Surveyor's sensitive infrared detectors
      will track the most elusive near-Earth objects. Dark asteroids and comets
      don't reflect much visible light, for example, but they will glow in the
      infrared spectrum as they’re heated by sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, NEO Surveyor will be able to find asteroids that approach
      Earth from the direction of the Sun, as well as ones both leading and
      trailing our planet's orbit, where they are typically obscured by the
      glare of sunlight. All of these are threats that larger ground-based
      observatories could miss.

        <h2>NEO Surveyor’s Aluminum Telescope Mounted to Its Flight Base</h2>
        <p>
          The aluminum telescope of NASA’s Near-Earth Object (NEO) Surveyor
          mission is shown here attached to its flight base frame at a Space
          Dynamics Laboratory (SDL) clean room in Logan, Utah, in early
          September 2025. The telescope is connected via a system of struts that
          prevent heat from passing from the spacecraft to the instrument,
          keeping it secure, isolated, and cool. The spacecraft’s instrument
          enclosure will later be fitted over the instrumentation and then the
          pair will be attached to the spacecraft bus and sunshade. With an
          aperture of nearly 20 inches (50 centimeters), the telescope features
          detectors sensitive to two infrared wavelengths in which near-Earth
          objects re-radiate solar heat. The instrument enclosure is designed to
          ensure heat produced by the spacecraft and instrument during
          operations doesn’t interfere with its infrared observations.

    <h2>Why We're Launching NEO Surveyor</h2>
    <p>Finding near-Earth objects is required by law.</p>
    <p>
      We can only do something about hazardous near-Earth objects if we can find
      them first.
    </p>
    <p>
      NEO Surveyor will find asteroids and comets that other space missions
      cannot, filling a critical gap in humanity’s ability to detect potentially
      hazardous near-Earth objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to planetary defense, scientists will use data from NEO
      Surveyor for studies of near-Earth objects to learn more about the
      evolution of the solar system.

    <h2>Europa Clipper</h2>
    <img src="images/Europaclipper.jpg" alt="Europa Clipper Image" />
    <p>
      Europa Clipper is the first mission designed to conduct a detailed study
      of Jupiter's moon Europa. There’s scientific evidence that the ingredients
      for life may exist on Europa right now. The spacecraft will travel 1.8
      billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers) to reach Jupiter in April 2030. It
      will orbit Jupiter, and conduct 49 close flybys of Europa.
    </p>
    <h3>What Will Europa Clipper Do?</h3>
    <p>
      Europa Clipper’s three main science objectives are to understand the
      nature of the ice shell and the ocean beneath it, along with the moon’s
      composition and geology. The mission’s detailed exploration of Europa will
      help scientists better understand the astrobiological potential for
      habitable worlds beyond our planet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spacecraft will perform dozens of close flybys of Jupiter’s moon
      Europa, gathering detailed measurements to investigate the moon. The
      spacecraft, in orbit around Jupiter, will make nearly 50 flybys of Europa
      at closest-approach altitudes as low as 16 miles (25 kilometers) above the
      surface, soaring over a different location during each flyby to scan
      nearly the entire moon.

        <h2>NASA’s Largest Planetary Mission Spacecraft</h2>
        <p>
          With its massive solar arrays and radar antennas, Europa Clipper is
          the largest spacecraft NASA has ever developed for a planetary
          mission. The spacecraft has large solar arrays to collect enough light
          for its power needs as it operates in the Jupiter system, which is
          more than five times as far from the Sun as Earth. The spacecraft will
          be about 16 feet (5 meters) in height. With its arrays deployed, the
          spacecraft spans more than 100 feet (30.5 meters) and has a dry mass
          (no propellant in the tanks) of 7,145 pounds (3,241 kg).

    </div>
    <h3>Designed for Jupiter’s Tough Radiation Environment</h3>
    <p>
      Because Europa is bathed in radiation trapped in Jupiter's magnetic field,
      Europa Clipper's payload and other electronics will be enclosed in a
      thick-walled vault. This strategy of armoring up to go to Jupiter with a
      radiation vault was developed and successfully used for the first time by
      NASA’s Juno spacecraft. The vault walls – made of titanium and aluminum –
      will act as a radiation shield against most of the high-energy atomic
      particles, dramatically slowing down degradation of the spacecraft's
      electronics.
    </p>
    <h3>Life Beyond Earth</h3>
    <p>
      Europa shows strong evidence for an ocean of liquid water beneath its icy
      crust. Beyond Earth, Europa is considered one of the most promising places
      where we might find currently habitable environments in our solar system.
      Europa Clipper will determine whether there are places below Europa’s
      surface that could support life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spacecraft's payload will include cameras and spectrometers to produce
      high-resolution images and composition maps of Europa's surface and thin
      atmosphere, an ice-penetrating radar to search for subsurface water, and a
      magnetometer and gravity measurements to unlock clues about its ocean and
      deep interior. The spacecraft will also carry a thermal instrument to
      pinpoint locations of warmer ice and perhaps recent eruptions of water,
      and instruments to measure the composition of tiny particles in the moon's
      thin atmosphere and surrounding space environment.

    <h2>Psyche</h2>
    <img src="images/Psyche.jpg" alt="Psyche Image" />
    <p>
      Psyche is on its way to begin exploring asteroid Psyche by August 2029.
      Scientists think the asteroid has a high metal content, and may be the
      partial core of a planetesimal, a building block of an early planet.
    </p>
    <h3>What Will Psyche Do?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Psyche is a NASA mission to study a metal-rich asteroid with the same
        name, located in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Asteroid Psyche’s gravity will capture the spacecraft in late July 2029,
      and Psyche will begin its prime mission in August. It will spend about two
      years orbiting the asteroid to take pictures, map the surface, and collect
      data to determine Psyche’s composition.
    </p>
    <h3>What Will Psyche Do?</h3>
    <p>
      The Psyche spacecraft launched Oct. 13, 2023, at 10:19 a.m. EDT from
      Kennedy Space Center. Psyche lifted off from Launch Pad 39A aboard a
      SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. Psyche was the first in a series of NASA
      science missions to be the primary payloads launched on a SpaceX Falcon
      Heavy rocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spacecraft separated from its rocket about an hour after launch, and
      around the 90-minute mark established two-way communication with NASA’s
      Deep Space Network complex in Canberra, Australia, at 11:50 a.m. EDT.

        <h2>The Journey to Asteroid Psyche</h2>
        <p>
          Psyche was discovered in 1852 by Italian astronomer Annibale de
          Gasparis. Because it was the 16th asteroid to be discovered, it is
          sometimes referred to as 16 Psyche. It’s named for the goddess of the
          soul in ancient Greek mythology, often depicted as a butterfly-winged
          female figure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Psyche orbits the Sun in the outer part of the main asteroid belt
          between Mars and Jupiter. It is approximately three times farther from
          the Sun than Earth. Because Psyche and Earth orbit at different
          speeds, the distance from Earth to Psyche varies from less than 186
          million miles to more than 372 million miles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Psyche is irregular and potato-like. If the asteroid were sliced in
          half horizontally at the equator – picture a squished oval – it would
          measure 173 miles (280 kilometers) across at its widest point and 144
          miles (232 kilometers) long. Its surface area is 64,000 square miles
          (165,800 square kilometers).
        </p>
        <p>
          Psyche is dense, estimated at about 212 to 256 pounds per cubic foot
          (3,400 to 4,100 kilograms per cubic meter). The surface gravity on
          Psyche is much less than it is on Earth – even less than it is on
          Earth’s Moon. On Psyche, lifting a car would feel like lifting a large
          dog.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scientists think Psyche may consist of significant amounts of metal
          from the core of a planetesimal, one of the building blocks of our
          solar system. The asteroid is most likely a survivor of multiple
          violent hit-and-run collisions, common when the solar system was
          forming.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are still contradictions in the data, but scientific analysis
          indicates that Psyche is likely made of a mixture of rock and metal,
          with metal composing 30% to 60% of its volume. The asteroid’s
          composition has been determined by radar observations and by the
          measurements of the asteroid’s thermal inertia (how quickly an object
          gains or re-radiates heat).
