    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Building on the success of NASA's NEOWISE space telescope, the agency's
      NEO Surveyor will be the first spacecraft built specifically to find large
      numbers of asteroids and comets that are potentially hazardous to Earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it scans the solar system, NEO Surveyor's sensitive infrared detectors
      will track the most elusive near-Earth objects. Dark asteroids and comets
      don't reflect much visible light, for example, but they will glow in the
      infrared spectrum as they’re heated by sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, NEO Surveyor will be able to find asteroids that approach
      Earth from the direction of the Sun, as well as ones both leading and
      trailing our planet's orbit, where they are typically obscured by the
      glare of sunlight. All of these are threats that larger ground-based
      observatories could miss.

        <h2>NEO Surveyor’s Aluminum Telescope Mounted to Its Flight Base</h2>
        <p>
          The aluminum telescope of NASA’s Near-Earth Object (NEO) Surveyor
          mission is shown here attached to its flight base frame at a Space
          Dynamics Laboratory (SDL) clean room in Logan, Utah, in early
          September 2025. The telescope is connected via a system of struts that
          prevent heat from passing from the spacecraft to the instrument,
          keeping it secure, isolated, and cool. The spacecraft’s instrument
          enclosure will later be fitted over the instrumentation and then the
          pair will be attached to the spacecraft bus and sunshade. With an
          aperture of nearly 20 inches (50 centimeters), the telescope features
          detectors sensitive to two infrared wavelengths in which near-Earth
          objects re-radiate solar heat. The instrument enclosure is designed to
          ensure heat produced by the spacecraft and instrument during
          operations doesn’t interfere with its infrared observations.

    <h2>Why We're Launching NEO Surveyor</h2>
    <p>Finding near-Earth objects is required by law.</p>
    <p>
      We can only do something about hazardous near-Earth objects if we can find
      them first.
    </p>
    <p>
      NEO Surveyor will find asteroids and comets that other space missions
      cannot, filling a critical gap in humanity’s ability to detect potentially
      hazardous near-Earth objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to planetary defense, scientists will use data from NEO
      Surveyor for studies of near-Earth objects to learn more about the
      evolution of the solar system.
