      <h1>Our Galaxy(Milky Way)</h1>

      <p>
        Our home galaxy is called the Milky Way. It’s a spiral galaxy with a
        disk of stars spanning more than 100,000 light-years. Earth is located
        along one of the galaxy’s spiral arms, about halfway from the center.
        Our solar system takes about 240 million years to orbit the Milky Way
        just once.
      </p>
      <p>
        From our perspective on Earth, the Milky Way looks like a faint, milky
        band of light arcing across the entire sky, which is how it got its
        name. This feature marks the central disk of our home galaxy seen edge
        on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Milky Way sits in a neighborhood with over 50 other galaxies called
        the Local Group. Its members range in size from dwarf galaxies (smaller
        galaxies with up to a few billion stars) to Andromeda, our nearest large
        galactic neighbor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Local Group sits just off the edge of the Virgo cluster and is part
        of the Laniakea supercluster.

      <h3>Mercure</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>
          Far smaller and closer to the Sun than it should be, Mercury has long
          baffled astronomers because it defies much of what we know about
          planet formation. A new space mission arriving in 2026 might solve the
          mystery.</strong

      <p>
        At a cursory glance, Mercury might well be the Solar System's dullest
        planet. Its barren surface has few notable features, there is no
        evidence of water in its past and the planet's wispy atmosphere is
        tenuous at best. The likelihood of life being found amidst its scotched
        craters is non-existent. Yet, look closer and Mercury is a fascinating,
        improbable world that is shrouded in mystery.

      <h3>Venus</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>
          Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and the sixth largest planet.
          It’s the hottest planet in our solar system.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Venus is a cloud-swaddled planet and our nearest planetary neighbor. It
        has a surface hot enough to melt lead.
