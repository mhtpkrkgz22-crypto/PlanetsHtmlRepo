      <p>
        Our home galaxy is called the Milky Way. It’s a spiral galaxy with a
        disk of stars spanning more than 100,000 light-years. Earth is located
        along one of the galaxy’s spiral arms, about halfway from the center.
        Our solar system takes about 240 million years to orbit the Milky Way
        just once.
      </p>
      <p>
        From our perspective on Earth, the Milky Way looks like a faint, milky
        band of light arcing across the entire sky, which is how it got its
        name. This feature marks the central disk of our home galaxy seen edge
        on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Milky Way sits in a neighborhood with over 50 other galaxies called
        the Local Group. Its members range in size from dwarf galaxies (smaller
        galaxies with up to a few billion stars) to Andromeda, our nearest large
        galactic neighbor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Local Group sits just off the edge of the Virgo cluster and is part
        of the Laniakea supercluster.
