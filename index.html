      <h1>Our Galaxy(Milky Way)</h1>
      <hr />
      <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/universe/galaxies/" target="_blank"

      <p>
        Our home galaxy is called the Milky Way. It’s a spiral galaxy with a
        disk of stars spanning more than 100,000 light-years. Earth is located
        along one of the galaxy’s spiral arms, about halfway from the center.
        Our solar system takes about 240 million years to orbit the Milky Way
        just once.
      </p>
      <p>
        From our perspective on Earth, the Milky Way looks like a faint, milky
        band of light arcing across the entire sky, which is how it got its
        name. This feature marks the central disk of our home galaxy seen edge
        on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Milky Way sits in a neighborhood with over 50 other galaxies called
        the Local Group. Its members range in size from dwarf galaxies (smaller
        galaxies with up to a few billion stars) to Andromeda, our nearest large
        galactic neighbor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Local Group sits just off the edge of the Virgo cluster and is part
        of the Laniakea supercluster.

      <h2>Planets</h2>
      <h3>Mercure</h3>
      <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mercury/" target="_blank"
        ><img src="images/merkur.jpg" alt="Mercure Image"
      /></a>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Far smaller and closer to the Sun than it should be, Mercury has long
          baffled astronomers because it defies much of what we know about
          planet formation. A new space mission arriving in 2026 might solve the
          mystery.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        At a cursory glance, Mercury might well be the Solar System's dullest
        planet. Its barren surface has few notable features, there is no
        evidence of water in its past and the planet's wispy atmosphere is
        tenuous at best. The likelihood of life being found amidst its scotched
        craters is non-existent. Yet, look closer and Mercury is a fascinating,
        improbable world that is shrouded in mystery.

      <h3>Venus</h3>
      <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/venus/" target="_blank"
        ><img src="images/venus.jpg" alt="Venus Image"
      /></a>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and the sixth largest planet.
          It’s the hottest planet in our solar system.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Venus is a cloud-swaddled planet and our nearest planetary neighbor. It
        has a surface hot enough to melt lead.
      </p>

      <hr />
      <h3>Earth</h3>
      <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/" target="_blank"
        ><img src="images/earth.jpg" alt="Earth Image"
      /></a>
      <p>
        While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is
        the only planet in our solar system with liquid water on the surface.
        Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four
        planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Earth is the only planet in the solar system whose English name does not
        come from Greek or Roman mythology. The name was taken from Old English
        and Germanic. It simply means "the ground." There are, of course, many
        names for our planet in the thousands of languages spoken by the people
        of the third planet from the Sun.
      </p>

      <h3>Mars</h3>
      <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mars/" target="_blank"
        ><img src="images/mars.jpg" alt="Mars Image"
      /></a>
      <p>
        Mars is no place for the faint-hearted. It’s dry, rocky, and bitter
        cold. The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars is one of Earth's two closest
        planetary neighbors (Venus is the other). Mars is one of the easiest
        planets to spot in the night sky — It looks like a bright red point of
        light.
      </p>

      <h3>Jupiter</h3>
      <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/" target="_blank"
        ><img src="images/jupiter.jpg" alt="Jupiter Image"
      /></a>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Jupiter is the largest and oldest planet in our solar system.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If Jupiter was a hollow shell, 1,000 Earths could fit inside. But the
        "King of Planets" is no lumbering giant — Jupiter has the shortest day
        in the solar system, taking about 9.9 hours to spin around once on its
        axis.
      </p>

      <h3>Saturn</h3>
      <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/" target="_blank"
        ><img src="images/saturn.jpg" alt="Saturn Image"
      /></a>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet
          in our solar system.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. It's
        surrounded by a beautiful ring system. It's the farthest planet from
        Earth discovered by the unaided human eye.
      </p>

      <h3>Uranus</h3>
      <img src="images/uranus.jpg" alt="Uranus Image" />
      <p>
        <strong
          >Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and the third largest
          planet in our solar system – about four times wider than Earth.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Uranus is very cold and windy. It is surrounded by faint rings, and more
        than two dozen small moons. It rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from
        the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin on
        its side.

      <h3>Neptune</h3>
      <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/neptune/" target="_blank"
        ><img src="images/neptun.jpg" alt="Neptune Image"
      /></a>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, giant Neptune is the
          eighth and most distant major planet orbiting our Sun.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        More than 30 times as far from the Sun as is Earth, Neptune is not
        visible to the naked eye. Neptune was the first planet located using
        math.
